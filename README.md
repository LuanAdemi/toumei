<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
> This is in active development so the README might be outdated and is not listing all things currently implemented. *See the dev branch for more information.*

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuanAdemi/toumei/master/assets/feature_overview.png">

*toumei* is a little sideproject of mine, trying to combine state of the art interpretability and model editing methods into a pythonic library. The goal is to compile useful methods into a coherent toolchain and make complexe methods accessible using a intuitive syntax. 

I think interpretability methods became quite powerful and therefore useful in the last couple years, wanting me to provide a library for broader use of these methods.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

*toumei* **can not** be installed using `pip`. To use toumei by running the experiments or adding it to your projects, please follow the guide below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following libraries are installed or install them using 
```sh
pip install torch torchvision tqdm matplotlib transformers seaborn scikit-learn networkx
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LuanAdemi/toumei.git
   ```
2. Run the experiments
   ```sh
   cd toumei/experiments
   python <experiment>.py
   ```
3. Move the library to your project
   ```sh
   cd ..
   cp toumei <path_to_your_project>
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Simple feature visualization
In order to perform feature visualization on a convolutional model we are going to need two things: a image parameterization method and an objective.

These are located in the `toumei.cnn` package.

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as T

# import toumei
import toumei.cnns.objectives as obj
import toumei.cnns.parameterization as param
```
Next, we are going to import a model we can perform feature visualization on
```python
from toumei.models import Inception5h

# the model we want to analyze
model = Inception5h(pretrained=True)

```
To counter noise in the optimization process, we are going to define a transfrom function used to perfom transformation robustness regularization
```python
# compose the image transformation for regularization through transformations robustness
transform = T.Compose([
    T.Pad(12),
    T.RandomRotation((-10, 11)),
    T.Lambda(lambda x: x*255 - 117)  # inception needs this
])
```
We are now able to define our objective pipeline using a image parameterization method (here FFT) and our objective (visualize unit mixed3a:74)

```python

# define a feature visualization pipeline
fv = obj.Pipeline(
    # the image generator object
    param.Transform(param.FFTImage(1, 3, 224, 224), transform),

    # the objective function
    obj.Channel("mixed3a:74")
)

```
Finally, we are going to optimize our pipeline and plot the results
```python

# attach the pipeline to the model
fv.attach(model)

# send the objective to the gpu
fv.to(torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"))

# optimize the objective
fv.optimize()

# plot the results
fv.plot()
```

### Causal Tracing
If we want to locate factual knowledge in GPT like models, we can use causal tracing. *toumei* implements this in the `toumei.transformers.rome` package.
```python
from toumei.transformers.rome.tracing import CausalTracer
```
This will import everything we need to perform causal tracing. Using huggingfaces transformers library we can easily get a model we can perform causal tracing on
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# load gpt2 from huggingface
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2-xl", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2-xl")

model.to(torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"))
```
After defining a prompt and specifying the subject, we can create a CausalTracer object and trace the model using the prompt

```python
# specify a prompt and it's subject for causal tracing
prompt = "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is located in the country of"
subject = "Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"

# perform causal tracing
tracer = CausalTracer(model, tokenizer)
tracer.trace(prompt, subject, verbose=True)
```

### Measuring Model Modularity
*toumei* implements the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08058.pdf">modularity metric derived from graph theory</a> for common deep learning architectures such as MLPs and CNNs.

We start by converting our model to an actual graph, we can perform graph algorithms on. *toumei* provides different wrappers for every architecture, which can be imported from the `misc` package

```python
from toumei.misc import MLPGraph, CNNGraph
```
Next we import and initialize some models, of which we want to measure the modularity of.

```python
from toumei.models import SimpleMLP, SimpleCNN

# create the models
mlp = SimpleMLP(4, 4)
cnn = SimpleCNN(1, 10)
```
Wrapping these models with the imported classes builds the corresponding weighted graph of the model

```python
# create graph from the model
mlp_graph = MLPGraph(mlp)
cnn_graph = CNNGraph(cnn)
```

This wrapper allows us to perform all sorts of graph algorithms on it. We can get the modularity of the graph by performing spectral clustering on it to partition the graph in $n$ communities we can use to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)">graph modularity</a>.

This is all done internally by calling 
```python
# calculate the modularity
print(mlp_graph.get_model_modularity())
print(cnn_graph.get_model_modularity())
```
